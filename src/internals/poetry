==My life==
And one more hill 
and one more sill
and one more hill I run

And I refuse
Refuse to stop
Refuse to stop till done


==A wish==
And at the end of my days
When I'm lying in a ditch covered in snow,
Alone,
Because all those who loved me, either died out or left me
At that very moment, before I draw my very last breath
I'd like to be able to think to myself:
-I lived as a good man

==Walking next to my father==
